# day 4 homework feedback

the plots look great! congrats on successfully labeling the ticklabels in the second round of plots!

Very correct and insightful comment on the trends in your heatmap within the README -- well done!

Please add more detail within the README regarding the comparison of your homework simulation with the real study

Please update your code to show creation of both heatmaps.

Also, one more small, but optional comment. The assignment does ask you to incorporate the nested for loop and storing the power within the `run_experiment()` function rather than calling that function repeatedly. What you've done works and leads to the same conclusions, but consider how you might edit the function to incorporate the new code. While your results will be the same every time your script is run, will your results be the same compared to someone who only calls the `run_experiment()` function once therefore only sets the random seed once?
