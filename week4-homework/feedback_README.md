Great start! Your plink commands all look correct, and the code for your PCA plot also looks great (I ran it, and it worked, but in the future, make sure you remember to upload your plots). It also looks like you've got a good start on your manhattan plots. Here's what we still need from you before this is complete:

1. Your AF plot and code to make it (-1 point)
2. The rest of your manhattan plot code and the plots (-3 points)
3. Your boxplot and code (-1.5 points)
4. Your answer for question 7 (-1 point)

Great work so far.
