This is a great, Emma! You're almost done. PCA and ranking genes in groups looks great. We did want you to color the tSNE and UMAP plots by the leiden clusters, but don't worry about that. There are a few more things we need before this is complete:
1. I see the code to produce the "support" plots for part 4, but I only actually see one of your support plots. That said, the code should work, so no points deducted)
2. I also do not see the final plot with the clusters labelled with cell types (-1.5 points)
(8.5/10)
