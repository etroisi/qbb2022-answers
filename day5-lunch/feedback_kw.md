# day 5 lunch feedback

Great work overall, but please include the following things:

## Exercise 1

What code did you use to make `probandsandparentage`?

## Exercise 2

The histogram file is blank

Also, I did not see code or a conclusion for the 6th question "Test whether the number of maternally inherited de novo mutations per proband is significantly different than the number of paternally inherited de novo mutations per proband."
