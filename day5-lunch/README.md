Homework Day 5

yes, statistically signficant relationship between mother age and mother mutation (mutations from mother)
(6.878e-24). it is 0.3776 (in the equation y=mx+b for linear regression, m = 0.3776 (slope of the line). as x increases (age), y increases by 0.3776(mutation))

yes, statistically signficant relationship between father age and father mutation (mutations from father)
(1.552e-84). it is 1.3538 (in the equation y=mx+b for linear regression, m = 1.3538 (slope of the line). as x increases (age), y increases by 1.3538(mutation))

78.50500000000001 mutations if the father was 50.5
