readme for assignment 8 week 9 Bulk RNA-seq

If there is no relationship between fpkm and developmental stage, you would expect each p value to have the same chance of occurring as any other p value. therefore, under the null hypothesis, the distribution would be uniform.

Multiple testing corrections: Each gene is tested 1 time, say you have 1000 genes. Say you know that there are 10 that do have a relationship to y. if your p value is 0.05, that means youâ€™ll get 50 false positives. So, false discovery rate is 5/6 (50 false, 10 true, 60 total, 50/60 are false). This is high. If you want to lower it, meaning you would identify fewer false positives, you would need to lower the p-value that is considered significant. One way to do this is to divide the original pvalue by the number of tests--> 0.05/1000 = 0.00005. This would mean that you would get 0.05 false positives (so 0 false positives), which would make the FDR 0.05/10, which would be 0.005, essentially 0.
