## Week 6 -- 10 points possible

0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 4 of 10 points possible

1. Given data question: What percentage of reads are valid interactions?

2. Given data question: What constitutes the majority of invalid 3C pairs?/What does it mean?

3. Script set up to (0.5 pts each)

  * read in data  
  * Filter data based on location  

4. Script set up to log transform the scores

5. Script set up to shift the data by subtracting minimum value

6. Script set up to convert sparse data into square matrix

7. Script set up to (0.33 pts each)

  * remove distance dependent signal
  * smooth
  * subtract

8. Turned in the plot of the 3 heatmaps (ddCTCF, dCTCF, and difference) for subset dataset (0.33 pts each ddCTCF/dCTCF/difference)

* I think this is the plot that was turned in


9. Turned in the plot of the 3 heatmaps (ddCTCF, dCTCF, and difference) for full dataset (0.33 pts each ddCTCF/dCTCF/difference)

* I don't think I see this plot

10. Heatmap questions (0.33 pts each)

  * See the highlighted difference from the original figure?
  * impact of sequencing depth?
  * highlighted signal indicates?

Possible Bonus points:

1. Insulation script set up to (0.25 pts each)

  * read in data
  * filter data based on location
  * log transform the data
  * shift the data by subtracting minimum value

2. Insulation script set up to (0.5 pts each)

  * convert sparse data into square matrix
  * find the insulation score by taking mean of 5x5 squares of interactions around target

3. Turned in the plot of the heatmap + insulation scores below (0.5 pts each panel)

**I don't see the script for making a 3 panel heatmap; I only see 1 of the 2 required 3 panel heatmaps; and there is no README that responds to the questions in the assignment. Please upload these for points back and let me know if you have any questions.**
