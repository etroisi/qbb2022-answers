Exercise 1:
portion that 
*** Subsetting .vcf for each feature
--- Subsetting exons.chr21.bed.vcf
    + Covering 1107407 bp
--- Subsetting processed_pseudogene.chr21.bed.vcf
    + Covering 956640 bp
--- Subsetting protein_coding.chr21.bed.vcf
    + Covering 13780687 bp

	creates file subset_regions.sh
	
	to confirm if the graphs match: open the files and compare
	-cmp -b file1 file2
	b will print where the files differ
	note: files differ on the version of matplotlib 
	
	transcribed unprocessed pseudogene vs transcript processed pseudogene vs processed pseudogene? snRNA
